# UPS MCP Server
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for UPS shipping and logistics capabilities. This server enables AI systems to seamlessly integrate with UPS API tools. 

Users can integrate with the MCP server to allow AI agents to facilitate tracking events on their behalf, including tracking the status of a shipment, the latest transit screen, and expected delivery date and time. Agents will be authenticated using OAuth client credentials provided by the user after application creation on the UPS Developer Portal.  

## Usage
**Prerequisites**
- Obtain a Client ID and Client Secret: Create an application on the UPS Developer Portal to obtain your OAuth credentials – Client ID and Client Secret. (https://developer.ups.com/get-started?loc=en_US)
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Install uv (Python Package)

**Environment Variables**
- ```CLIENT_ID``` - UPS Client ID
- ```CLIENT_SECRET``` - UPS Client Secret
- ```ENVIRONMENT``` - Whether to point to Test (CIE) or Production (Accepted values: test, production)

**Note**: Your API credentials are sensitive. Do not commit them to version control. We recommend managing secrets securely using GitHub Secrets, a vault, or a password manager.

**Execution**

You can run the package using uvx:

```uvx --from git+https://github.com/UPS-API/ups-mcp ups-mcp```

To use an older version, you can specify the version number like so:

```uvx --from git+https://github.com/UPS-API/ups-mcp@v1.0.0 ups-mcp```
